# CodeIgniter Backend Developer

We are looking for skilled CodeIgniter backend devs. Go through below objective and send the best you got. We would like to see novel approaches as much as traditional ones.

## Challenge
Make a CodeIgniter app with following features. No front end required. Print raw output when required.

 1. Create a library to interact with [Medium](https://medium.com/) REST API using Integration Tokens.
 2. Create a Controller called profile. GET current profile via library and display only the name & url.
 3. Create a Controller called post. Listen to get params (title & content) and submit a post to medium via library as draft.
 4. Create a Controller called publications. GET publications of associated medium account via library and display output.

## Keep in mind

 - Develop using CodeIgniter 3.X
 - Write **CLEAN** & **MODERN** code
 - Store Medium Integration Token in constants config file
 - Do not use any third-party libraries or packages
 - Library should be independent. Receive Integration Token on construct method as a parameter
 - Create a public repo on github for the finished project and send the link to below email
